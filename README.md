# Web-Design-Challenge

These pages can be seen all together at https://kstrange89.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

This is a continuation of the python-api-challenge in which I used APIs to gather weather data from around the world in order to find the best place to go for vacation.

Here, I have created a web page discussing my findings. Using Bootstrap and jQueary in HTML, I created a seven page website.
The main page gives a brief summary of the information the website contains.
There are four pages devoted to the four measures of weather we used. These pages compare their weather measure against latitude to see if modelling can be applied.
The comparison page looks at the effect of latitude on the different measures to see which are most effected by change in latitude.
The data page provides a table with all of the data that was used in the analysis, ordered by latitude from north to south.
