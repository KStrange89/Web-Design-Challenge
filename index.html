        How does weather change as distance from the equator changes?
    </h1>
    <h3>
        <p>
            On this site, we will be looking at how distance from the equator effects weather patterns. To gather this data, we chose a random sample of lattitude and longitude points from around the world, found the city closest to the coordinate point, and viewed weather data from that city. We then compiled the data into a table and used the table to create scatterplots and find correlation.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The measures of weather used are temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. The weather data was taken from <a href="openweathermap.org" target="_blank">openweathermap.org</a>.
